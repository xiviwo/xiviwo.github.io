##This is Me


My ears hear what others cannot hear; small faraway things people cannot normally see are visible to me. 

These senses are the fruits of a lifetime of longing, longing to be rescued, to be completed. 

Just as the skirt needs the wind to billow, I'm not formed by things that are of myself alone. 

I wear my father's belt tied around my mother's blouse, and shoes which are from my uncle. 

This is me. 

Just as a flower does not choose its color, we are not responsible for what we have come to be. 

Only once you realize this do you become free, and to become adult is to become free.
